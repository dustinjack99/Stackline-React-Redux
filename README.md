Hello friends at Stackline!

A few things: I used a quick and dirty chart.js for the graph.

Use the up and down arrows or a scroll wheel to scroll through the chart at the bottom.

I'm not sure what best practices for Redux you follow, so I went with DUCKS? Hope that's alright!

Hope to hear from you all soon!
